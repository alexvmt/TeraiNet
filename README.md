## Motivation

- tigers are an endangered species
- there is no open and easy way for ecologists/researchers/NGOs
to detect and classify their camera trap images with regard to tigers
- ML and open data/tools can help reduce the amount of manual labor
when sifting through large amounts of camera trap data, looking for the needle in the haystack

## Data

- LILA BC
- amur tiger re-identification challenge at CVWC 2019

## Training

- MEWC
- EfficientNetV2
- Google Colab

## Deployment

- HuggingFace
- EcoAssist
